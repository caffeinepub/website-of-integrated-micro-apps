  "summary": "The diff partially adds the requested markdown outline document, but the added file content is truncated and does not provide enough visible evidence that the required explicit test cases, multi-tenant/workflow/failure scenarios, and the manual multi-identity execution plan are actually included. Additionally, several frontend code changes appear that were not requested by REQ-18/REQ-19.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-18",
      "requirement": "Add a compact test suite outline document for the shared interoperability layer enumerating API tests for getInteropContext, getUserRole, and logActivity including isolation tests, contract/shape assertions, multi-tenant boundary tests, workflow-chain tests, and failure-condition tests with the specified explicit scenarios.",
      "reason": "While a new markdown file exists and begins an outline, the visible content only shows the title, overview, and the start of one isolation test (Anonymous/No Profile). The diff content is truncated before any explicit coverage for the required getInteropContext cases (no active org, active org, role resolution), logActivity cases, multi-tenant boundaries, workflow-chain scenarios, and failure-condition tests can be verified.",

      "reason": "The added markdown content shown does not include (within the visible/truncated portion) a manual execution plan, multiple-identity steps, or the required explicit method references and expected outputs/observations. Therefore implementation cannot be confirmed from the provided diff excerpt.",
